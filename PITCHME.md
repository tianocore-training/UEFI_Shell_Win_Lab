Note:

Next for this lab there are a few shell commands that will help us with debugging. For example if you are writing a driver, you would want to get familiar with these shell commands. Each of these commands will have a help option to give you further information about these commands.

We are not going to go all were these in detail but just to make you aware of the shell commands.

### <p align="right"><span class="gold" >Shell Help</span></p>


Note:

Next let’s just try the help shell command. So once you reach the shell go ahead and type: “help –b”
And what you will see is the list of all the shell commands built into this platform followed by a one liner information about each command.
To exit, this emulation simply type: “reset”

Note:
The UEFI Shell can execute commands from a file, which is called a batch script file (.nsh files).

Benefits: These files allow users to simplify routine or repetitive tasks. <br>
- Perform basic flow control. 
- Allow branching and looping in a script. 
- Allow users to control input and output and call other batch programs (known as script nesting).

### <p align="right"><span class="gold" >Writing UEFI Shell Scripts </span></p>

Note:

With the UEFI shell There is an editor included. This is a very simple editor but can help if running on the target system without an OS "Nice" editor available.

SHell editor help  menu - Cnt W

At the shell prompt

Shell> fs0:

FS0:\> edit HelloScript.nsh 

Type : echo “Hello World“



Press “F2”- Enter Press “F3” to exit

Note:

In the shell, type HelloScript for the following result:

```
HelloScript.nsh
```

Close - at the shell prompt type : reset

Note:
walk through the script calling the second script
- if
- for loop
  - %a counting down...
